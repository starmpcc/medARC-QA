Assess the Situation: The woman has a snake wrapped tightly around her arm, causing loss of sensation and a bluish discoloration, indicating compromised blood flow. The loss of radial pulse suggests that the snake's constriction is severe and could lead to tissue damage or necrosis.\n\n2. Immediate Action: The primary concern is to relieve the constriction to restore blood flow and prevent further damage. However, removing the snake yourself could be dangerous, as it might cause the snake to bite or release venom if it is not non-venomous as claimed.\n\n3. Seeking Help: The best course of action is to seek appropriate help from medical professionals who are trained to handle such situations. They can safely remove the snake and provide the necessary medical care.\n\n4. Avoiding Harmful Actions: Amputating the arm (Option A) is an extreme measure and not the first line of action. An X-ray (Option B) is not immediately necessary and does not address the urgent need to relieve the constriction. Injecting the snake with phenobarbital (Option C) is not a standard or safe practice for this situation.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate course of action is to seek appropriate help.

NIHSS Score Breakdown:\n   - Level of Consciousness: Lethargic or non-responsive (score of 3)\n   - Best Language: Global aphasia; unable to speak or understand language (score of 3)\n   - Motor Function (Arm): Total paralysis of both arms (score of 4)\n   - Motor Function (Leg): Total paralysis of both legs (score of 4)\n   - Sensory: Loss of sensation on one side of the body (score of 2)\n   - Facial Palsy: Complete facial droop on one side (score of 2)\n   - Ataxia: Severe ataxia on both sides (score of 2)\n   - Visual Field: Complete homonymous hemianopia (loss of half of the visual field) (score of 2)\n   - Dysarthria: Severe dysarthria, making speech almost unintelligible (score of 2)\n\n4. Next Best Action: Given the patient's severe neurological deficits and obtundation, it is crucial to determine the underlying cause of his condition. The patient is intubated and has a history of ESRD, which increases the risk of bleeding. Therefore, administering thrombolytic therapy (such as tPA) without ruling out hemorrhagic stroke would be contraindicated.\n\n5. Ruling Out Hemorrhagic Stroke: The next best action is to perform a CT head scan to rule out acute hemorrhagic stroke. This is essential before considering any thrombolytic therapy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) CT Head to rule out acute hemorrhagic stroke.\n\nThe answer is (E)."}, {"question_id": "ID043", "question": "A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-hour history of severe, crushing chest pain that radiates to his left arm and jaw.

Patient Presentation: The patient is a 45-year-old woman with sharp, left-sided chest pain that worsens with deep breathing, sudden-onset shortness of breath, and mild leg swelling in her left calf. She has a history of a recent long-haul flight, which is a risk factor for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).\n\n2. Vital Signs and Physical Examination: Her vital signs show tachycardia (pulse of 110/min) and hypoxemia (SpO\u2082 of 86% on room air). The physical examination reveals mild calf tenderness and swelling, which suggests a possible DVT.\n\n3. Diagnostic Findings: The electrocardiogram shows sinus tachycardia without ST-T changes, and the chest X-ray is normal. These findings do not rule out PE, as PE can present with normal ECG and chest X-ray.\n\n4. Differential Diagnosis: Given the symptoms and risk factors, the most likely diagnosis is a pulmonary embolism (PE). The presence of calf tenderness and swelling suggests a possible DVT, which can lead to PE.\n\n5. Next Step in Management: The most appropriate next step in management for a suspected PE is to confirm the diagnosis.

Patient Presentation: The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic dysarthria, and atrial fibrillation. He presents with acute left arm weakness and a history of headache and prior stroke. His last known normal was 2 hours ago.\n\n2. Symptoms and Examination: The patient has a blood pressure of 150/90, grafted arm weakness, and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 3 due to dysarthria and arm weakness. The rest of the neurologic exam is unremarkable.\n\n3. Immediate Concerns: Given the acute onset of symptoms and the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and prior stroke, there is a high suspicion of a stroke. The patient is on warfarin, which increases the risk of bleeding.\n\n4. Next Steps in Stroke Management: The primary goal in a suspected stroke is to quickly determine the type of stroke (ischemic vs. hemorrhagic) to guide treatment. \n\n5. Imaging: \n   - CT Head: A non-contrast CT scan of the head is typically the first imaging modality used in the emergency setting to rule out hemorrhagic stroke. It is quick and widely available.\n   - MRI Brain: While MRI is more sensitive for detecting ischemic strokes, it is not typically the first-line imaging in the acute setting due to longer acquisition times and less availability in emergency departments.\n\n6. Other Options:\n   - Labetalol: This is a medication used to lower blood pressure, but it is not the immediate next step in the management of a suspected stroke.\n   - EKG: While an EKG is important for assessing cardiac rhythm, it is not the immediate next step in the context of acute stroke symptoms.\n   - Query the device: This option is not relevant to the immediate management of the patient's symptoms.\n\nGiven the need for rapid assessment to rule out hemorrhagic stroke and guide further management, the best immediate next step is to perform a CT Head.\n\nThe answer is (E)."}, {"question_id": "ID100", "question": "You are the chief resident in a busy hospital's trauma unit during a particularly chaotic evening shift.
