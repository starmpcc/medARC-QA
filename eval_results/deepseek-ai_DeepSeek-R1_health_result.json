Oral contrast was not administered.           Findings:      Gallbladder:              The gallbladder is markedly distended, measuring up to 10 cm.         There is pronounced gallbladder wall thickening of approximately _5_ mm (normal \u22643 mm).         The gallbladder wall demonstrates hyperenhancement after contrast administration.

If the device is faulty, correcting it resolves the issue without invasive testing.
