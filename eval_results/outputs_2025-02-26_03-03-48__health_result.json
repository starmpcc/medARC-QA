Presenting with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain, hypotension, and elevated lactate.         High clinical suspicion for acute mesenteric ischemia.           Findings:      1. Bowel Findings:              Diffuse bowel wall thickening, particularly affecting the small intestine, with poor enhancement of the affected bowel segments, indicating diminished perfusion.         Bowel walls demonstrate areas of hypoattenuation, consistent with severe ischemia, and lack the typical contrast enhancement, suggestive of non-viable bowel.         Multiple loops of bowel show intramural gas (pneumatosis intestinalis), a concerning sign for bowel infarction.         Gas is also seen within the mesenteric veins and branches of the portal vein (portomesenteric venous gas), further indicating advanced ischemia.           2. Mesenteric Vasculature:              Evidence of thromboembolic occlusion in the superior mesenteric artery with minimal collateral flow.         The mesenteric fat demonstrates stranding and edema, consistent with vascular compromise and inflammation secondary to ischemia.           3.
