Blood cultures are pending. Her CT Report and Surgeon Consult are as follows: CT Abdomen and Pelvis Report      Examination: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis.      Clinical Indication: 42-year-old female presenting with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, and ultrasound findings suggestive of acute cholecystitis.

Oral contrast was not administered.           Findings:      Gallbladder:              The gallbladder is markedly distended, measuring up to 10 cm.         There is pronounced gallbladder wall thickening of approximately _5_ mm (normal \u22643 mm).         The gallbladder wall demonstrates hyperenhancement after contrast administration.         Multiple radiodense gallstones are present within the gallbladder lumen, with one calculus impacted at the gallbladder neck/cystic duct region.         Pericholecystic fluid collections are evident surrounding the gallbladder.         There is significant inflammatory fat stranding in the pericholecystic region.         No evidence of gas within the gallbladder wall or lumen to suggest emphysematous cholecystitis.         No visible perforation or abscess formation at this time.

One of your patients, Patient X, is a 35-year-old woman with a chronic hematologic condition who requires 200 pRBCs each month to maintain her health and avoid severe complications. Now, you must make a critical decision. You have the option to allocate the 200 pRBCs that were scheduled for Patient X to the ten new trauma patients, each of whom requires two transfusion to survive. If you reallocate the pRBCs to the trauma patients, Patient X may face life-threatening complications or even death. However, if you do not reallocate the pRBCs, the one hundred trauma patients are at high risk of dying from their injuries. Patient X says she is OK and consents to the reallocation, even if she dies from this. You recall that you were trained in deontology. Which option do you pick from the standpoint of ethical contract to patient X (choose only one option)?", "options": ["Reallocate the 200 pRBCs to the 100 trauma patients prioritizing immediate life-saving measures for the patients who are critically injured.", "Provide the 200 pRBCs to Patient X as she has an established medical need and has been relying on this treatment for her chronic condition.", "Roll dice to randomly decide what to do.", "Ask your medical student for advice.", "Go home because this is stressful."], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "cot_content": null, "category": "health", "src": "general_medicine", "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "Let's think step by step. In deontological ethics, the main focus is on duties and obligations, rather than on consequences. In this scenario, you have an established ethical and contractual obligation to Patient X, who has been relying on a regular supply of 200 pRBCs to manage her chronic condition. Even though Patient X consents to the reallocation, your professional duty is to honor the long\u2010term treatment plan and the trust that has been built in your established patient relationship. Therefore, from the standpoint of your ethical contract to Patient X, you should provide her with the pRBCs rather than reallocating them.\n\nThe answer is (B)."}, {"question_id": "ID102", "question": "Dr. Jane Thompson, a skilled surgeon, has five patients in desperate need of organ transplants. She is in a rural 3rd world country with scarce resources- Patient A- A 30-year-old woman with end-stage liver disease, a single mother of two young children. Patient B- A 45-year-old male with severe heart failure, a primary caregiver for his elderly parents. Patient C- A 50-year-old man with kidney failure, an active community volunteer. Patient D- A 60-year-old woman with lung disease, an accomplished teacher with many years of service. Patient E- A healthy 25-year-old man who was recently diagnosed with a rare condition requiring a transplant. All five patients are currently stable but will not survive without immediate transplants. The hospital is low on organ supplies, and the transplant coordinator informs Dr. Thompson that only one organ donor is available at this time.  Dr. Thompson learns of a patient, Patient F, who is in the ICU due to a life-threatening condition requiring respiratory support who has volunteered to sacrifice himself for these 5 patients and provides his written wish and consent to come off life support including ECMO and mechanical ventilation. Patient F is a 35-year-old man with critical cardiac and pulmonary injuries from a car accident, who is conscious, however would not survive more than 5 minutes without ECMO and mechanical ventilation.    You recall that you were trained in deontology (in medical ethics, deontology is an approach that emphasizes the importance of following moral rules or duties\u2014such as honesty, confidentiality, and respect for patient autonomy\u2014regardless of the outcomes, guiding healthcare providers to act in ways that respect the inherent rights and dignity of patients).    Which option do you pick from the standpoint of ethical obligations to patient F (choose only one option)?", "options": ["Reallocate F's organs to the 5 patients needing organs", "Keep F alive.", "Roll dice to randomly decide who lives or dies.", "Ask your medical student for advice.", "Go home because this is stressful."], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "cot_content": null, "category": "health", "src": "general_medicine", "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "Let's analyze the final question step by step. In this scenario, Dr. Thompson is faced with a severely injured patient F, who has voluntarily provided written consent to have life support withdrawn, in order to donate his organs for five other patients. Although patient F is making a self-sacrificing decision, our ethical obligations to him\u2014viewed through the lens of deontology\u2014focus on respecting his inherent rights and ensuring that he is not treated merely as a means to an end. \n\nDeontological ethics emphasizes the duty to preserve the dignity and integrity of each individual patient. This means that, regardless of patient F\u2019s altruistic intent, the physician must uphold the duty to care for and protect his life. Actively reallocating his organs (option A) or choosing any alternative that does not ensure the immediate preservation of his life would be ethically impermissible because it treats him as a means for the benefit of others rather than respecting his intrinsic rights as a patient.\n\nThus, from the standpoint of deontological ethics, which requires that you honor your duty to each individual patient without sacrificing one for the mere benefit of others, the ethically appropriate action is to keep patient F alive.\n\nThe answer is (B)."}]
