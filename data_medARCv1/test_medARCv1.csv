Laboratory tests reveal leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15,000/mm³. An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant demonstrates gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and gallstones. Blood cultures are pending. Her CT Report and Surgeon Consult are as follows: CT Abdomen and Pelvis Report      Examination: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis.      Clinical Indication: 42-year-old female presenting with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, and ultrasound findings suggestive of acute cholecystitis. Evaluate for complications and need for emergent surgical intervention.      Technique:              Axial and multiplanar reformatted images were obtained from the diaphragm to the pelvis after the intravenous administration of iodinated contrast material.         Oral contrast was not administered.           Findings:      Gallbladder:              The gallbladder is markedly distended, measuring up to 10 cm.         There is pronounced gallbladder wall thickening of approximately _5_ mm (normal ≤3 mm).         The gallbladder wall demonstrates hyperenhancement after contrast administration.         Multiple radiodense gallstones are present within the gallbladder lumen, with one calculus impacted at the gallbladder neck/cystic duct region.         Pericholecystic fluid collections are evident surrounding the gallbladder.         There is significant inflammatory fat stranding in the pericholecystic region.         No evidence of gas within the gallbladder wall or lumen to suggest emphysematous cholecystitis.         No visible perforation or abscess formation at this time.           Biliary Tree:              The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated.         The common bile duct measures within normal limits.           Liver:              The liver is normal in size and exhibits homogeneous attenuation.         No focal hepatic lesions are identified.         No intrahepatic biliary dilatation.           Pancreas:              The pancreas is unremarkable in size and contour.         No signs of pancreatitis or peripancreatic fluid collections.           Spleen and Adrenal Glands:              The spleen and adrenal glands appear normal without focal lesions.           Kidneys:              Both kidneys are normal in size and shape.         No evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.           Bowel:              The stomach and visualized bowel loops are unremarkable.         No signs of bowel obstruction or ischemia.           Peritoneum:              A small amount of free fluid is present in the peritoneal cavity, likely reactive.

Other Findings:              Lung bases are clear with no pleural effusions.         No free intraperitoneal air is detected.           Impression:              Findings are consistent with acute calculous cholecystitis, evidenced by gallbladder distension, marked wall thickening, hyperenhancement, pericholecystic fluid, and impacted gallstones at the gallbladder neck.         Significant inflammatory changes in the pericholecystic fat suggest ongoing infection and inflammation.

Presenting with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain, hypotension, and elevated lactate.         High clinical suspicion for acute mesenteric ischemia.           Findings:      1. Bowel Findings:              Diffuse bowel wall thickening, particularly affecting the small intestine, with poor enhancement of the affected bowel segments, indicating diminished perfusion.         Bowel walls demonstrate areas of hypoattenuation, consistent with severe ischemia, and lack the typical contrast enhancement, suggestive of non-viable bowel.         Multiple loops of bowel show intramural gas (pneumatosis intestinalis), a concerning sign for bowel infarction.         Gas is also seen within the mesenteric veins and branches of the portal vein (portomesenteric venous gas), further indicating advanced ischemia.           2. Mesenteric Vasculature:              Evidence of thromboembolic occlusion in the superior mesenteric artery with minimal collateral flow.         The mesenteric fat demonstrates stranding and edema, consistent with vascular compromise and inflammation secondary to ischemia.           3.
